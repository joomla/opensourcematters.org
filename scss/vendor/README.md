## Vendor Modules
These contain overrides to vendor components (i.e. the stuff served from the media/vendor directory) within the Core

These are duplicated from the Joomla.org template. The only modification currently is the extra _nn_sliders.scss file -
but that should be replicated back into the Joomla.org template repo at the right moment as we use this extension on
several of our core sites.
